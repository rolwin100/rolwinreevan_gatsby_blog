excerpt: Reflecting on my first ever hackathon experience.
---

Last week, I took part in IBM's 2020 Intern Hackathon. Given that this was my first ever hackathon along with the fact that it was taking place online, I wasn't sure what to expect. Throughout the road to a minimum viable product, my team encountered many obstacles. Countless pages of intractable documentation, long outdated technology, and a rapidly approaching deadline brought us to the brink of giving up. However, when we eventually reached out for help, we were greeted with mentors who were both educated and eager to help. Special thanks to Igor Braga, Sadiyah Faruk, Sanjeev Gupta, and Jordan D. for lending a hand when we needed it most.

Although we weren't selected as finalists this year, we were able to create a piece of technology that I believe is immediately relevant in the age of COVID-19. In our short two-day sprint, we were able to combine edge computing and machine learning to operate a controlled barrier based on whether or not those entering a certain space are wearing face masks.

To Zachary Lau, Kaitlin de Chastelain Finnigan, Shuyi Wang, and Luke Iremadze, thanks for being the best team members I could have ever asked for. And of course, a huge thank you to IBM for making this year's digital hackathon an amazing experience!
